	<h1><small>Report Layout </small></h1>
	<p> The score of each test item is represented as the percentage of performance compared to the highest value obtained across all platform. So a value of <b>x%</b> means that the test case/	 	 scenario performance is <b> x% </b> compared to the highest scored platform, which is always given <b> 100% </b>.</br>
        To know the ranking calculation and actual values scored by each platform on specific test cases, please refer to the raw values excel provided along with the report.
        Please click <a href="{% static 'links/score_Calculation.html' %}" target="_blank"> <b>here</b></a> for more details. </p>
	The <b>score summary</b> is the percentage of performance of each platform for individual test scenarios. The detailed sections shows the individual test case score(rank) in the same fashion. <br>
